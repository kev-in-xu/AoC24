All days! Finally. Third time's the charm.

Day 14 (robot easter egg) and 21 (numpad recursion) were definitely the hardest. They required some visual examination of outputs and pen-and-paper work. 

Day 17 (assembly simulation) and 24 (adder gates) were especially fun having just taken Fundies this semester.

Thanks Eric! AoC got me into CS ngl.
